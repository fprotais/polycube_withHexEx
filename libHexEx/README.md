## What is HexEx?

HexEx is a method for robust hex mesh extraction from 3D Integer-Grid Maps with imperfections.
(Imperfect) 3D Integer-Grid Maps are what is generated by most state-of-the-art hex meshing
methods such as CubeCover \[[Nieser et al. 2011](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8659.2011.02014.x)\].

Hex extraction is a complicated task because numerous special cases, ambiguities induced
by numerical inaccuracies and limited solver precision, as well as imperfections in the
maps pose significant challenges to the hex mesh extractor.

to find out why hex extraction is complicated and how we tackle it, or skip ahead and
